Without the wheels being slid in and locked, you cannot attach the wheelcaps or at least I couldn't. I did not have the strength.

B. King","helpful":[0,1],"reviewText":"For maybe 15 years I have been using the same footrest under my workstations.  It's the tube kind with the board covered in some kind of vinyl for traction.  Maybe once or twice I tracked in some mud that got on the board.  Tapping the board over a garbage can knocked off the dirt. Every once in a while, I vacuum the board while getting up the dust bunnies.  So I am puzzled by the Microban Protection. I never touch the footrest with anything but the bottom of my shoes, other than the events previously mentioned.  Why would anyone sane care about microbes on a footrest? Or on the bottom of ones shoes for that matter?  I even sniffed at the old board, no moldy microbe smell.Next the rocking feature: As I write this review my feet are flexing back and forth.  I feel like a teenager with too much energy. When I really need to flex my foot, I stick it out and rotate the ankle a few times.  Rocking back and forth does not provide relief.  I tried this as a footstool last night while watching TV.  Nope, just another thing on the floor.At my home workstation we have a keyboard tray. Using this foot rocker under that desk was uncomfortable because even my short legs bumped against the tray.  Here at work, the rocker inches away. Then when I use it again it bumps against the wall. Fortunately the person on the other side is away now. I know I would be annoyed at random thumping.  The old footrest has rubber tubing that keeps it in place.  This thing skitters around.Assembly: The box is easy to open. A minimum of packing material is used. The pieces are well protected.  The instructions are simple drawings on box. You can figure it out with a moment or two of thought.  However the tolerances are quite tight, which is a good thing once the contraption is assembled.  I could not push the rocker into position bare-handed.  Fortunately I had a 15\" rubber mallet handy. A couple of taps and everything snapped into place.So if you are a nervous germaphobe who doesn't worry about your rocker bumping against the wall, perhaps this is for you.  And if it is, contact me and I will send you mine. I have no idea what I am going to do with this sample.","overall":2,"summary":"eliminates a problem that does not exist","unixReviewTime":1306281600,"reviewTime":"05 25, 2011","reviewed_at":"2011-05-25T00:00:00","feedback_count":1,"feedback_helpful_count":0,"feedback_unhelpful_count":1,"feedback_helpful_ratio":0.0,"review_text_word_count":399},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-09-21T04:18:17.059930Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T04:58:06.629333Z","inner_id":59,"project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":58,"annotations":[{"id":56,"completed_by":2,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-09-21T04:54:10.387345Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T04:54:10.387369Z","lead_time":16.12,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":58,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"7c75cd51-reviews_Office_Products_5-16087.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"index":16087,"reviewerID":"A1SZHOQJVZ4X09","asin":"B001B0DCSU","reviewerName":"M.

Where I grew up, that's all we've had available to us for all of my lifetime, so I was surprised to come to live in the US and find that people were still licking envelopes to close them.  When I saw this item, my first thought was \"oh, thank goodness - at last!\"  The self-seal aspect of the envelope works very well.  The glue seems to seal the envelope well and keep it sealed.  The only issue I have had with them is that the glue seems to want to hold the flap down prior to use and I had to ease it up in order to fold it in and seal it.  My concern would be that with time, the flaps might actually seal open and thus be unusable.These envelopes also have a security feature to allow you to mail checks without risk that the contents of the envelope can be read.  I can't remember the last time I needed to mail a check so I will not need to use them for this purpose.  Nevertheless, being able to send correspondence with full assurance that the envelope cannot be held up to the light and the contents read through the paper, provides a degree of confidence in the product.Last, I wanted to add that the paper from which the envelopes are made is high quality, thick paper.  The envelopes do not feel flimsy at all.  I suspect this makes them less likely to be torn while going through the postal machines, and in fact less likely to get in or cause a jam of the USPS equipment.","overall":5,"summary":"Quality Park Reveal-N-Seal Envelope #10 Envelopes","unixReviewTime":1279065600,"reviewTime":"07 14, 2010","reviewed_at":"2010-07-14T00:00:00","feedback_count":1,"feedback_helpful_count":1,"feedback_unhelpful_count":0,"feedback_helpful_ratio":1.0,"review_text_word_count":276},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-09-21T04:18:17.059475Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T04:45:09.962234Z","inner_id":51,"project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":50,"annotations":[{"id":48,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":306,"end":461,"text":"The latest software synchronizes with your Outlook Contacts so it is \"easy breezy\" to create address labels for those who are in your Outlook address book","labels":["benefit"]},"id":"Jt5s0SJ6uC","from_name":"pros_and_cons","to_name":"review_text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":561,"end":674,"text":"The disk that comes with the printer installs the software (addressing & stamps) but does NOT install the drive","labels":["drawback"]},"id":"hVJMw35_U5","from_name":"pros_and_cons","to_name":"review_text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-09-21T04:41:56.835520Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T04:41:56.835545Z","lead_time":94.996,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":50,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"fa4a3293-reviews_Office_Products_5-7987.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"index":7987,"reviewerID":"A3HJHV83O2U8BL","asin":"B0009VU7QC","reviewerName":"Robert A.

I have to say that both the movie and stapler are great. An interesting bit of trivia: -- there was no such thing as a red Swingline stapler when the movie was made. The prop department spray painted a black model. But high demand from fans of the movie prompted Swingline to release a red model in 2002. They were a bit behind the times since other companies had colored staplers much earlier (Bates Colormatics for one).Okay, it looks neat and is a conversation piece, but does it work? Yes, so far. There's nothing I hate more than a stapler that always jams. It was a gift, and replaced a generic black model in office. It uses the same common #4 staples so there's no need to invest in a new box if you already have a supply of them.

It is substandard at best and produces very  mixed results.Usually we print stuff on FAST (economy) and while the cartridge is rated for 200 pages, we actually got around 250-300 on the first one which puts it at around 125-150 for Normal.  (Usually fast\/economy uses half the ink as it only does a single pass instead of two or three)  The strange part is.. the second cartridge we got was terrible performance.  I estimate by around 150 Fast\/Economy the cartridge was starting to show it was almost out of ink already which would put it at around 75-100 pages normal!?I was a bit shocked because there was such a deviation.  I did some research and found out that HP rates their Cartridges using an ISO standard Text document. They test on a J4580 printer which is an INK SAVER printer. If you do not own a J4580 then obviously you will get different results.Because it is rated on a Text document keep in mind, print out a page that is loaded with black bars(like a bar graph) it will devour your ink; yet print out a page that has only a small amount of text you could go for 300+ pages easily.  I rarely complain about ink cartridges but I must say HP really should put some more ink into the standard 901 black; considering a 901XL has over 3x the rating (200 vs 700). Plus they should rate them using a \"Standard\" printer not an Ink Saver printer.  VERY MISLEADING !!OVERALLAvoid the 901 black!!  While they perform just fine and do have black ink in it that works, the cartridges performance is determined by how much black you print per page not by # of pages.  I would recommend instead spending the extra money and getting the 901XL black which is rated for 700 pages.  Once I got one of those I found I was able to print an entire ream of paper (500 pages) and the cartridge was still 50% full (all on economy\/fast)  So despite paying twice the price I already DOUBLED my output compared to a 901 standardIn short.. avoid!!  get the 901XL as it will pay for itself.","overall":1,"summary":"Avoid...

My PC is for general-use with a non-studio configuration (no mixer, non-phantom power mics, headphone monitoring).If you're buying for a studio setup requiring phantom power or multiple inputs, you'll need a separate mixer and\/or standalone phantom supply. From the mixer you can cable to the US-100's line input via RCA jacks on the back.There were a couple of hiccups during setup, but I don't blame the device. It uses stock O\/S drivers that loaded right up. The documentation is minimal and only covers up to Vista, but it's accurate and you'll manage with Win7. On the Windows side make the USB AudioCodec your default recording and playback device to override any onboard or card-based audio and speakers (I have Realtek onboard and 2.1 desktop speakers).I'm using ASIO4ALL with Cubase and Cubase crashed a couple of times while configuring VST connections and I\/O busses. Once configured however, it's been solid.I'd recommend checking out user forums for your particular software\/platform to find similar gotchas and to set your expectations.On an XP machine, changing the default sound devices often means the hassle of toggling settings before and after launching the DAW. On Win7, once I unplug the US-100, the settings revert nicely to my desktop speakers. If I plug the US-100 back in, the settings revert again - very reliable. Even better, if I want to use Cubase strictly for MIDI, the software detects the change and I don't have to reconfigure connections or busses. That may be a function of Cubase, so again it pays to research your particular software.While the US-100 is connected, you'll hear nothing from your computer speakers and have to rely upon the US-100's headphone jack or audio out RCA jacks. This is where the balance control is very helpful. It's not a pan, it's a center position gain mixing the computer's output (from within your DAW as well as outside system sounds) with direct monitoring of your input signal. Very simple to use for overdubbing. Some people may prefer a hard left\/right pan while overdubbing: I can live with the center mix though a switch to toggle a true pan would have been a terrific feature.If you do want desktop speaker playback after your tracks are done, there are a number ways to go: 1) Unplug the US-100 and restart your DAW. 2) Run a cable from the RCA outs on the US-100 to the mini-jack aux in on your desktop speakers 3) Run a mini-jack extension cord from the headphone jack on the US-100 to the aux-in.While using the headphone jack, the RCA audio outs are muted and vis-versa. Rather than having to pull out the headphone I would prefer a push switch that toggles the front to back output, but I can live without it.Again, the US-100 works great so long as your needs meet its capabilities. You can't rely on the product description or packaging to answer that. Fortunately there's enough user-information out there for just about any setup it shouldn't be difficult to track down.","overall":4,"summary":"Consider Your Setup and How You Like to Work","unixReviewTime":1290729600,"reviewTime":"11 26, 2010","reviewed_at":"2010-11-26T00:00:00","feedback_count":10,"feedback_helpful_count":10,"feedback_unhelpful_count":0,"feedback_helpful_ratio":1.0,"review_text_word_count":522},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-09-18T14:35:16.345541Z","updated_at":"2022-09-19T15:52:29.250991Z","inner_id":19,"project":1,"updated_by":3},{"id":17,"annotations":[{"id":17,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"start":253,"end":296,"text":"it is tricky to learn and limited in scope.","labels":["drawback"]},"id":"p_-UXGXP9h","from_name":"pros_and_cons","to_name":"review_text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":297,"end":453,"text":"t only works well under these circumstances: All notes must be played slowly, individually and deliberately in order for the attack delay effect to kick in","labels":["drawback"]},"id":"EZ9R6KflFc","from_name":"pros_and_cons","to_name":"review_text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":455,"end":532,"text":"You can't play a quick series of notes and expect the effect to work properly","labels":["drawback"]},"id":"D-birZNGxZ","from_name":"pros_and_cons","to_name":"review_text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":552,"end":583,"text":"I found that the effect is nice","labels":["benefit"]},"id":"Zpiqy-RObV","from_name":"pros_and_cons","to_name":"review_text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":623,"end":722,"text":"I tried to use it in conjunction with overdrive and sustain pedals and it did not work well at all.","labels":["drawback"]},"id":"FVOsOrcek7","from_name":"pros_and_cons","to_name":"review_text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-09-19T15:46:06.133356Z","updated_at":"2022-09-19T15:46:06.133380Z","lead_time":489.43,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":17,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"895600c8-reviews_Musical_Instruments_5-5604.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"index":5604,"reviewerID":"A2JPRN080WBJ4N","asin":"B000T9NKEU","reviewerName":"Mike Black","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"I bought this effect because I saw a few YouTube demos that made it look pretty good.

It only works well under these circumstances: All notes must be played slowly, individually and deliberately in order for the attack delay effect to kick in.

However, I play standing up and manipulating the volume pedal was difficult to control because of balancing on one foot and the sensitivity of some of the pedals.This pedal gives a simulation of the volume swells that give steel guitar that distinctive sound. It's sort of like an automatic wah in the way it works. Since the steel is always being played by picking the individual strings (no chording), this pedal works along with that technique. I combine it with a sustainer to make the swells extend a little, and it gives a fair approximation of using a volume pedal to swell the notes.I tried this with regular guitar, but it's not the same. For chords, it does add an effect, but it's not very distinctive, and for single notes, it would depend on the song. I haven't really found many instances where it's useful there either, as I normally don't want volume swells for solos on guitar, but on steel guitar, it works very well.","overall":4,"summary":"Good for steel guitar","unixReviewTime":1400025600,"reviewTime":"05 14, 2014","reviewed_at":"2014-05-14T00:00:00","feedback_count":0,"feedback_helpful_count":0,"feedback_unhelpful_count":0,"feedback_helpful_ratio":0.0,"review_text_word_count":208},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-09-18T14:35:16.345311Z","updated_at":"2022-09-19T15:34:37.749212Z","inner_id":15,"project":1,"updated_by":3},{"id":40,"annotations":[{"id":15,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":111,"end":150,"text":"It does the job with a clear, red beam","labels":["benefit"]},"id":"si43nXmNZv","from_name":"pros_and_cons","to_name":"review_text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":151,"end":280,"text":"The only thing that was frustrating was that it was a push on button that released automatically when the pressure was taken off","labels":["drawback"]},"id":"--UXrDsLaR","from_name":"pros_and_cons","to_name":"review_text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":443,"end":545,"text":"aving it turned on without an operator holding it may be a hazard so I'm sure it is a safety feature","labels":["benefit"]},"id":"jtDdOWpLMR","from_name":"pros_and_cons","to_name":"review_text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-09-19T15:29:22.327031Z","updated_at":"2022-09-19T15:29:22.327066Z","lead_time":116.759,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":40,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"57f6e6cd-reviews_Office_Products_5-37082.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"index":37082,"reviewerID":"A1EVV74UQYVKRY","asin":"B0050PNOUS","reviewerName":"K.

I just don't like the features of this stand at all.","overall":2,"summary":"Locking Legs Into Place Caused Their Finish To Become Scuffed Up","unixReviewTime":1389571200,"reviewTime":"01 13, 2014","reviewed_at":"2014-01-13T00:00:00","feedback_count":1,"feedback_helpful_count":1,"feedback_unhelpful_count":0,"feedback_helpful_ratio":1.0,"review_text_word_count":110},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-09-18T14:35:16.344682Z","updated_at":"2022-09-18T14:49:51.072215Z","inner_id":4,"project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":2,"annotations":[{"id":2,"completed_by":2,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-09-18T14:35:52.490980Z","updated_at":"2022-09-18T14:35:52.491011Z","lead_time":1.729,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"e33af28c-reviews_Office_Products_5-6912.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"index":6912,"reviewerID":"A2T4PF3X3MC0VC","asin":"B0006HXAW2","reviewerName":"Actinfaith","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"These pens were purchased for someone else, and as far as I know, the person is very satisfied with them.","overall":5,"summary":"A gift","unixReviewTime":1402272000,"reviewTime":"06 9, 2014","reviewed_at":"2014-06-09T00:00:00","feedback_count":0,"feedback_helpful_count":0,"feedback_unhelpful_count":0,"feedback_helpful_ratio":0.0,"review_text_word_count":20},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-09-18T14:25:48.275654Z","updated_at":"2022-09-18T14:35:52.526993Z","inner_id":2,"project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":1,"annotations":[{"id":1,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":74,"text":"Works perfectly for both my Martin dreadnought and my Fender Stratocaster","labels":["benefit"]},"id":"Alc10k7yzV","from_name":"pros_and_cons","to_name":"review_text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":76,"end":119,"text":"Solid unit, good material and construction","labels":["benefit"]},"id":"Af12vev_QS","from_name":"pros_and_cons","to_name":"review_text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-09-18T14:35:48.867904Z","updated_at":"2022-09-18T14:35:48.867931Z","lead_time":2.114,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"87a52141-reviews_Musical_Instruments_5-1852.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"index":1852,"reviewerID":"A13A81NN0NRD1S","asin":"B0002E3DLM","reviewerName":"aspiring saint \"TATITTLE\"","helpful":[1,1],"reviewText":"Works perfectly for both my Martin dreadnought and my Fender Stratocaster.
