  "reviewText": "I bought this gadget a few years ago for a camping trip and have used it sparingly since. The spike hammer worked \"ok\" , the few ounces the head weighs is ineffective for driving anything larger than a small nail. The hatchet side isn't very useful for any kind of real work except maybe butchering rabbit, lopping off fish tails or splitting a tiny log. The extra features like knife, saw etc. aren't bad in a pinch but w/o a locking mechanism they're not suitable in a self-defense scenario, (then again w/ a tiny hatchet in hand one still has an option). A serious woodsman or camper may find this indespensible but for a professonal handyman/ average joe like me, carrying this around serves little purpose. I'm happy w/ the tool because it appears & feels solid and hasn't rusted like other multi function tools I own and it's a neat tool. From a design/engineering standpoint (two things which I am not btw) the two riveted pins that hold the head to the body seem like a real weak point considering the twisting/shearing force they encounter w/ every blow of the ax, hammer or built in hex nut driver opening. An overall novelty that's unique and well made enough that I'm content.",
