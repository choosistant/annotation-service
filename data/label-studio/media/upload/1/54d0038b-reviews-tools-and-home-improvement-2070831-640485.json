  "reviewText": "First of all, if you don't have a drill press and a table saw don't even think of trying to build the clamp boards.  I have both, so that wasn't an issue for me.  The instructions state that the pads are optional, but they're really not if you're gluing 2-by lumber - the non-screw ends won't spread properly for 2-by's without the pads. \n \nOnce set up, they work well and deliver on all the promises.  Much better than pipe clamps.  Glad I bought them!",
