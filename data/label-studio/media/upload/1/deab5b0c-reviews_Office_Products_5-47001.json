  "reviewText": "I use this laptop lift with my Mac Book Pro 13'' and it fits just perfectly. It lifts about 30 degrees angle, which is perfect for my typing, and it makes the laptop raise to your eye level, so you don't have to tilt the screen, so it is perpendicular to your desk. It seems to be quality built, with a light weight plastic. I'd probably say it is built to stay in one place, like on the desk, but if you move it around, it may not be that good of an idea. Because your laptop would be up from your desk, the computer then does not heat as much, so that is actually very nice to help your computer live longer. This is a great product that I do recommend as a great addition to any office to ease typing.",
