  "reviewText": "These Smead Expanding Wallets measure 9-3/4\"  X 11-3/4\" and can expand up to 2\" thick.  They are made of heavy paper stock and come with elastic bands to hold the flaps close.  I have been using them for years for transportation of documents up to the letter size.  They afford documents an amount of protection on travel.  In the old days, there was only one color available - reddish brown.  This 4-pack comes with a variety of pastel colors.  However, they are pricey relatively to what I pay at the discount stores.",
