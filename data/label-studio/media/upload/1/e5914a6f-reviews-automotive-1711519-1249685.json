  "reviewText": "First off, installation is as easy as you can imagine, pop the hood, clip two wires, plug in ... DONE. Second, Innovative claims 2-5 MPG gains which are, from my experience, not attainable. I've had it on my 2016 Tundra 4.6L V8 for a dozen fill ups. I had an average of 17.1 MPG before the chip and now I'm pulling 17.9 MPG. Granted that is a 5% increase, which is nice but nowhere near their claims. I math it out to getting an extra gallon out of my tank each fill up. Therefore at $3/gallon it's almost paid off so what's the big deal other than some exaggerated performance claims. I see no difference in horsepower performance gains. As my initial review was declined, sellers on Amazon are A+++ and shipping is always fast, waaaah-whooooo!",
