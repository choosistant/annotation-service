  "reviewText": "I like the way this helmet looks, however the wind noise is unbearable. I silicone sealed the comms unit door trying to get it to be quieter, but it didn't help any. What I discovered was the lower rear vent on the left side of my head was where the wind was getting in. I put a piece of scotch tape over it and now the wind noise is much better. I need to take the liner out and figure out what the problem is. Overall it's a great helmet, but you will need to make some modifications to make the wind noise bearable.",
