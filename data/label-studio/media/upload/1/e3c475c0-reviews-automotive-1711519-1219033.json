  "reviewText": "The best deal on any helmet.  This is my second one. My first one cost nearly $250 for the exact same helmet... I got this one for LESS THAN HALF that, at $120.  It was a steal, considering that the \"transitions\" face shield it comes with is selling on Amazon for $120 by itself... so basically I got this helmet for FREE.  I will NEVER pay $500 dollars for a helmet.  You are throwing your money away, in my opinion.  BELL is the way to go. \n \nSpecifics: \n \nI always wear a LARGE in almost any helmet, and this one fit perfect.  It's also fairly comfortable. \n \nThe face shield seals well, plus it is the Transitions photochromatic shield which darkens in direct sunlight.  Sweet.  (All Bell \"DLX\" helmets come with the Transitions shield, btw) \n \nIt is a bit noisy, but hey - it's a freakin motorcycle.  If you want to travel in luxury and comfort, get your Lexus out of the garage. \n \nLooks cool, nice graphics and finish. \n \nIt's made by Bell - a leader in the industry for decades.  I feel safe.  It is a quality product.  You can't go wrong, especially if you can pick one up for anywhere near the price I just paid! \n \nGet one.  You can't really go wrong, and it could save your life.",
