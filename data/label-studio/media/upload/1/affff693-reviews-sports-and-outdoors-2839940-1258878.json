  "reviewText": "This item is a must-have for a Buck 112 Ranger or other similar knife. I have always had trouble finding a knife to suit me, as I prefer the more \"traditional\" pocketknives over the new \"tactical\" ones. However, I often end up needing to open a knife one-handed. The thumb stud version of this product originally took my interest, but I found this and decided to try it instead. It looks perfect on a knife with brass bolsters, especially if it is put on when both the thumb bar and bolsters are equally polished and allowed to tarnish evenly. It allows you to have a traditional pocketknife with a better look than the big thumb stud and still be able to open it one handed. If I ever lose my Buck 112, I can guarantee you the next one will get one of these right off the bat!",
