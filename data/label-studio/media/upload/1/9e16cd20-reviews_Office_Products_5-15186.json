  "reviewText": "I have an \"HP Officejet J4580 All-In-One\" device.  It was only a little over a hundred dollars, so I knew ink would be expensive, especially from using previous HP models.  I don't use it a great deal, but after about 200 pages, it ran out of black ink. The color ink lasted a little longer, but that's because I usually write letters without much color.  Actually, that doesn't bother me, although I have read that most printers will have ink that lasts longer.  The secret to this ink from HP is to buy through Amazon from `used' or `refurbished' sellers.  You can save nearly 50% on costs and some give you free shipping.  That's what I ended up doing.  It looks exactly like a brand new cartridge.  I would recommend that if you want quality color photographs, you will need to buy a high quality (and more expensive) printer.  This HP does not do well in reproduction, but for letters and ordinary flyers, its fine.",
