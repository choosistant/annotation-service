  "reviewText": "I purchased 4 of these to build a display case.  I guess my interpretation of \"Heavyweight\" is vastly different..... these a a light gauge, flimsy material.  The \"Diamond Plate\" is stamped into the material from the back side, giving it a cheap/cheesy look. \n  All of the ones I received are bowed WAY out in the middle, and many of the holes (obviously punched) are ragged, and raised on the back side.....meaning that pegboard hooks will not fit, nor stay in the holes.  Very poor attention to detail, and/or no QC involved in production. \n \n  This was pretty much a waste of money, and I would not recommend, nor purchase them.",
