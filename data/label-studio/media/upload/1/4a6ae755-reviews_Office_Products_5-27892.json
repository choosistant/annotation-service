  "reviewText": "The 12 year old child I gave this to described it as \"cool\", but didn't have much else to say about it.  Gadgets are cool!  But getting the good out of this little dictionary/spelling corrector does require reading directions, spending time playing around with it, and a bit of adult help.This device looks up words and definitions, allows kids to jump to highlighted words within definitions, finds rhyming words/synonyms/antonyms, pronounces words, offers spelling suggestions, times reading, and helps kids choose between often confused words.  My favorite feature is the capacity to save spelling word lists and work with them.  Hopefully with the next school year this item will get some use!Requires 4 batteries, so turning off when not in use is important.",
