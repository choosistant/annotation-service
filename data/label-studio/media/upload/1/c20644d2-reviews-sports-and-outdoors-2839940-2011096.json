  "reviewText": "So disappointed. \nVery excited to receive these wraps and worked great for all of 4 uses.  The forth day of use, the stitching of the Velcro popped lose and is just hanging by a few threads, making it unusable.  So disappointed they only lasted a few workouts. \nHad the product held together, I'd have easily given it 5 stars.",
