  "reviewText": "Wow. This was amazing. Yes, the wax needed to be heated for a lot longer than instructed (possibly because it was outside in the single-digit temperatures here for hours), but it got to a nice consistency. Unlike the drug store waxing, I experienced no rash or redness after the waxing. It was easy enough for a novice self-waxer to do both upper lip and eyebrow. Just a few more times with this, and I'll recoup my investment.Even if you're not into &#34;luxury&#34; beauty products, this one is definitely worth the extra cash. Do it.",
