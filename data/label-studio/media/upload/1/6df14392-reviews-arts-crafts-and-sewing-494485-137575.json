  "reviewText": "Very pretty cotton yarn, I love it. I originally bought it at Walmart, but was a tiny bit short to finish the baby blanket, so had to buy more on Amazon to finish it. Now I am finishing a baby dress to match. On the smaller dress the print is almost looking like purple camo! It didn't look that way with the blanket, since the pattern was more stretched out.",
