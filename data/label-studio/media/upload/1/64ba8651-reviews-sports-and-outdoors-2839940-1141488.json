  "reviewText": "I bought this for fishing in the marsh and taking home an keeper once in a while.  Not what I expected.  I'm not even sure how to really apply it to my uses.  Was really hoping for some instructions of how to use it also or some pictures.  It can't be complicated, but I'm not sure its intended design.  The float is larger than I thought, the rubber tubing is cool but seems large.  I still have to wait to use it, but I guess I was just expecting something interesting about it that would apply to wading situations.",
