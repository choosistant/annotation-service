  "reviewText": "Like most other reviewers, I think this is a fine product if you have a need it.  The envelope seals securely and provides a great deal of security.  Myself, I probably will never purchase this product again, but that says more about me and my needs than it does about these envelopes.  If you want or need security and want it in a self-sealing envelope, this will definitely need your needs.And that, my friend, is pretty much all there is to say about it.  Fine product if you need it.",
