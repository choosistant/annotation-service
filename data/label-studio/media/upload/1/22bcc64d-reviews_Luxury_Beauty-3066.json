  "reviewText": "After much hesitation, I tried this product and boy, am I glad I did. Having had no success whatsoever with sugaring, other waxing products in the past, other than extremely painful sugar/wax removals, I finally screwed up my courage and ordered it. I just tried it this past weekend on a leg and tiny hairs at the side of the mouth. After carefully reading the instructions and adhering strictly to them, this was no more painful to me than having your eyebrows tweezed. It is going to be somewhat time consuming as to be expected vs a salon treatment but my heavens, the difference in price and the luxury of doing this whenever you decide is fantastic. I too had a bit of a 'dribble effect' on my face, but I did not use the tiny spatula and did not twist the wax long enough to eliminate 'running down my face.\"  I know I will learn how to do this extremely well, love that I can reuse and reuse the wax (it is up to you in that regard - depending on where you are waxing and whether you want that re-heated hairy wax on you, so to speak).  Also be advised that I may be heating the wax too long even tho it was not remotely too hot on my skin, as I tended the get wax strings (like dribble strings at the dentist - gross but true) and tiny little blobs on me or the sink from the cup to the area being waxed. Will work on this every time I use and hopefully get much better at this (strings and blobs), however, I just scraped or peeled up the blobs and put them right back in the cup so no wastage in that regard.  Unless you are extremely pain sensitive, I think you will like this. Just remember to follow the instructions, pull the skin as taut as possible before peeling the wax off (in the opposite direction of hair growth) and be patient.4/10/12:  Very sorry to report that this seemingly stopped working, simply would not take the hair off my upper lip, chin, etc. As a good friend (pushing 60) has always told me: I had always heard you look like your mother as you get older (which was fine); no one ever said you would wind up looking like your father, i.e., hair on head, eyebrows thinning and yet sprouting like fresh sown grass elsewhere especially one's face. Peach fuzz ? Forget that!",
