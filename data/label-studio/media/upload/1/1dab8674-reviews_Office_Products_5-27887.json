  "reviewText": "My kids ages 6 & 8 initially played with this electronic dictionary quite a bit and more than I expected.  I thought the batteries had died when I wasn't able to turn it on one day shortly after it had arrived.  I pressed the tiny reset button on the back and it began functioning properly again.It's small, but a good size for small hands.  The voice is plenty loud and the level can be adjusted.  The voice itself sounds a lot like the digitized computer voice that Stephen Hawkings, the brilliant physicist, has to use to communicate except this one also sound a bit Italian.  I'm kind of surprised about that because I was thinking that for an \"English\" dictionary it would have an American or British accent.  Sometimes the voice is hard to understand and the word has to be repeated a few times until it's understood but overall it's fairly clear.The games are o.k. but they could have left tic-tac-toe out.  There's not much educational value in that but the Spelling Bee is very useful.  The screen is a throwback to the nineties with no color.  Only black lettering on a greenish background. The inside of the lid has some basic directions printed on the inside but the included \"user guide\" sheet has much more information.Overall it's not bad, especially for the price.  I see usefulness in it though it's not loaded with words and their definitions.  It didn't have some words for certain body parts, so at least you don't have worry about there being naughty words for your kids to look up.  And it has an automatic shut-off after being left on and unused for about 3 minutes.  I didn't time it, but it asks for your attention  about 3 or 4 times then shuts itself off.",
