  "reviewText": "Usually, when I use self-sealing envelopes, I have to tape the edges to keep them from coming unsealed during mailing.  Not so with the Reveal-N-Seal.  The glue goes all the way to the edge of the envelope, and it stays secure until it gets to its recipient.I also like that you can't see through these envelopes to see the contents.  The markings on the inside effectively hide anything I put in it.However, I had to take two stars off my rating, because these envelopes hang up in my HP Photosmart ink jet printer.  When it does go through the printer without hanging, the ink is still smeared.  I have never had this problem with my printer before.  This won't be a problem if you address all your envelopes by hand, but I prefer to use my printer for addressing my mail.",
