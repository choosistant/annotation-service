  "reviewText": "These are comfortable sunglasses.  The polarized lenses are a plus, but the optical characteristics seem substandard.  Regardless, it is not the lenses but rather the frame that detracts from these sunglasses.  They are LIGHT, to the point of distraction... they seem particularly vulnerable to getting knocked off your hat or head when not on the bridge of your nose.  They seem very fragile, and I don't have faith that they will last with even normal wear and tear. However, if I am wrong, I will revise this review.",
