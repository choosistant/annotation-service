  "reviewText": "Packaging kind of sucks these days.  How many times have you been tempted to hack at a blister pack with the nearest steak knife, or scraped helplessly at the plastic around a CD or DVD?  Scotch has come up with an elegant little solution, a retractable micro-blade in a nice, big handle.  The blade really is tiny, but it does what it says it does, it makes such short work of packaging that you won't believe it until your soy sauce starts dripping all over you, or your CD wrapping falls off.  It's sharp.  I mean it's really, really sharp, so don't go testing it on your fingers or anyone else's.It also makes short work of shipping tape so breaking down boxes no longer requires finding a pair of scissors or a knife I can live without.  With larger things, though, the cut is so shallow that the opener slides around a bit.  There's no inserting it under a box flap and cutting the tape straight across.It's refillable, though I haven't tried to do so.  I do know the cartridge snaps out pretty easily and back in just as simply.I can't think of too many things wrong with this opener.  The handle doesn't fit as comfortably in my hand as I'd like, but YMMV.",
