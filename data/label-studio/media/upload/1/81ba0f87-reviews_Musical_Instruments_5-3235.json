  "reviewText": "I purchased this desktop stand with the hopes that it would fully support the front weight of a condenser microphone and a shockmount together.  It does, and it does it well.  Very solid build, never felt cheap in any way.  Perfect for its intended use.  I purchased a second one after using the first for one month.  Would buy again should the need arise.",
