  "reviewText": "Good indoor training shoes for running on treadmill, doing lunges and regular exercises at the gym. These are very flexible, light weight and comfortable. Grip is okay - sticky rubber is used only at the edges of heel and toe areas so I slipped a little when I worked on cable machines, resistance band, etc. on un-carpeted floor.  I would emphasize that if you do lifting as a part of your everyday routine workout I would not recommend them because mine (cushion) lasted only for six months and this is the reason I gave three stars. Other than that, I liked them!",
