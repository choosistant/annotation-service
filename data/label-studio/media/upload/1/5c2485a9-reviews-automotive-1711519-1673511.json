  "reviewText": "Helmet arrived quickly. I was skeptical because of the lower price, but it's a genuine Bell and brand new. I love this helmet! It seems way lighter than my HJC CL17, and the transition lens works fantastic. It gets just as dark if not darker than a dark smoke, rather quickly. It's not real quiet or \nanything, but not too loud with all the vents. Highly recommend.",
