  "reviewText": "I'd call it a medium duty wrist wrap. I had another brand at the gym to do a side by side comparison. I did heavy bench press, heavy bag, dumbbells, and cable machine. I like these better than the other brand for everything except going heavy. They are super easy to put on and adjust. They feel good. They have good support. The velcro should be wider. I'm going to keep and use them. But I am also going time buy a pair or stuffer, more supportive wraps, for heavy lifting.",
