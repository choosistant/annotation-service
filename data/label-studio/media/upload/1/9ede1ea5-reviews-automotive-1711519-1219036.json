  "reviewText": "The helmet is nice. The first ride I took while wearing it, the rubber gasket around the shield started falling off. While trying to put it back on, I noticed that the gasket wasn't long enough. There was a gap. I've used the helmet and can't do anything but live with it like it is. I wish I had noticed it when I first took it out of the box. If you buy one, inspect it well before using it.",
