  "reviewText": "Pros:1.  Easy to use keyboard2.  Voice speaks to you3.  Gives dictionary definitions, has some games like Tic Tac Toe, Hangman.4.  You can see each word written slowly, letter-by-letter in manuscript or cursive.Cons:1.  Mechanical speaking voice sounds cold and sinister, not friendly at all!2.  Voice is very hard to understand.  In dictation game, I couldn't understand any of the words it asked me to spell.3.  \"Hangman\" game has some very odd word choices (like 'pis' - plural of pi). (!)4.  Lid contains the instructions, but flops backward; does not stand up to be read.5.  Battery cover requires ridiculously small Phillips screwdriver (not included)6.  Games, graphics, and sounds are all pretty lame.7.  Offers rhymes for your given word, but they are often strange choices, ie:  words that rhyme with \"red\":  hammerhead, outspread,  and behead.8.  Definitions are not particularly easy to read.Overall, this could be useful for a motivated 7-9 year old who has no access to a computer and is easily amused, but it's a bit primitive and doesn't really seem worth the effort.",
