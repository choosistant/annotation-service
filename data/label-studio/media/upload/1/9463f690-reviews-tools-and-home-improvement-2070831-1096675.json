  "reviewText": "These self adhesive dimming stickers do what is expected, by reducing the intensity of LED displays that cannot be dimmed on the device itself. They arrived in a standard business envelope, 2 sheets of shapes, pre-cut. They are very tiny, and even the largest of the pieces doesn't quite cover the display. I ended up creating a patchwork design of different sizes to cover the glaring LED. But they do perform the intended function. The little pieces of film are extremely thin, but fairly tough, and the adhesiion is adequate. They do not appear reusable, as I misapplied one piece and could not salvage it after removal.  In the future, I would likely buy the version of this product that is one solid sheet, and then cut my own shapes to size. EDIT: I have since purchased the whole-sheet Dim Its from which you can cut any size or shape to fit the need. I find this solution much more practical than the pre-cuts for my situation, but your needs may differ. I assessed the whole-sheet Dim Its 5 stars.",
