  "reviewText": "I wasn't expecing a whole lot for the price. I was hoping these would be dim, as my wife is bothered by other sleeping lights I have used which were very bright. this is much brighter, with both lights on. It's cool that there are two, and they have 2 levels, but wish they were a little less bright. \n \nOther issue is one of the lights is hard to get on and off. I should take it apart and fix. Probably a lose wire or something. Guess I can't really complain. \n \nThe dual light is definitely helpful, especially with a bigger book. If you don't have to worry about keeping someone awake with bright reading lights, get this, or something with 2 lights. It does make a difference.",
