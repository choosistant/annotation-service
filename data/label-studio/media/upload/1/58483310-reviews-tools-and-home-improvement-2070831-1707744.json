  "reviewText": "I bought two of these, one for myself and one for my wife. These turned out to be a poor purchase for reasons noted below. \n \nI am rating these with the price point in mind: \n \nPROS \n+ Reasonably small form-factor \n+ Solid enough construction \n \nCONS \n- Limited flexibility (once moved, the arms slowly return a bit to their original position) \n- Brightest setting not terribly bright \n- Work for about one to three minutes per power cycle \n \nWhen I received these lights I placed new batteries in them. Once turned on, no matter the setting, the lights slowly dimmed until they were unusable. This happens with both lights. Thinking I purchased a bad lot number for the batteries I bought some more batteries from a different manufacturer. The lights behaved exactly the same. Turn them on and they slowly dimmed to a point too dark to be useful. Turn them off and back on and the cycle repeats; bright, then slowly dims over one to three minutes. \n \nUnfortunately the lights I received server no practical purpose. Your mileage may vary.",
