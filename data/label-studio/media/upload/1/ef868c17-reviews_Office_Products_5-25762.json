  "reviewText": "The Fellowes foot rocker is nice for support. Raises your feet off the ground which makes you sit straighter in your seat making your back feel better. Puts less stress and pressure on my legs too. I have to say that I don't really rock with it but it does seem to provide relief from pressure in my legs when I do. I have to remind myself that it's there to use it but if you suffer from leg and back fatigue while sitting at your desk, it would help.",
