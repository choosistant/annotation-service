  "reviewText": "This is a nice stand, and I like having my laptop screen elevated, but it's not a natural position for typing.  Typing with your keyboard at a 45 makes your wrists feel like your hands are going to break right off your arms.But...add a USB keyboard to your system, and now you have yourself quite a setup.This stand lifts the front of my notebook about an inch in the front and six inches in the rear.  The tilt raises the display to a much more comfortable viewing angle and also pulls it in closer to your face.  It really is a nice change.As long as you aren't trying to use your built-in keyboard, this is a nice accessory.  Now pass me theBengay Cream, because my wrists & forearms are killing me.",
