  "reviewText": "I already have a few of these multi-tools, several Leatherman, Gerber and the Classic Swiss Army knives etc. \n \nBut I have yet seen one with an axe and hammer function, so I ordered this. \n \nI found it to be of excellent quality and workmanship, but limited in use. Functionally speaking, its not that useful at all. \n \nIts too large and too limited in functions when compared to a decent Swiss Army Knives. \n \nBut its too small and light to be of any use in any chores that requires some chopping and pounding. \n \nIts a \"better than nothing\" tool. \n \nYou can do so much better with a proper camping axe/hammer combo plus a nice little Swiss Army job.",
