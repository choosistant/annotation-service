  "reviewText": "I liked it but I didn't like it.  I like that the cord is smooth and won't easily damage the fish on the stringer which helps keep them alive until you're ready to head back to camp or home.  And the brass spikes are smooth and pointy enough to easily penetrate the skin behind the jaw and exit out the mouth, which is much better than going through the gill.  I have a zigzag lock on my kayak that hold the cord in place. \n \nHere's what I didn't like. The cord is 15' long, which I knew from the description, but that is just too much stringer for a 12' kayak or just about anything else other than stand on the shore.  The \"rubber\" cord is infused with ABS plastic which makes it a bit stiffer than pure rubber.  The 1/4\" cord diameter is overkill for stringing most lake or stream species of fish and adds to the cord being less flexible.  The ABS rubber cord has a lot of coil memory retention which means it stays in coils in the water which can interfere with your kayak fishing, even while trolling. \n \nI shortened the cord length by cutting it down to 8'-9' but I couldn't find a stringer stake for sale anywhere.  Then I realized that I didn't really need a stake for the float end.  Just looping the cord itself back into the float works just fine given that the cord is somewhat stiff anyway.  Then I secured one end of the stringer and gently pulled on the cord to stretch it out.  Repeated tugging got most of the coil retention out and now I don't store it in a tight coil.  A company that makes these things should figure all this out instead of the customer having too.  So what could have been a fantastic stringer only gets 3 stars, even though my version is now 5 stars.",
