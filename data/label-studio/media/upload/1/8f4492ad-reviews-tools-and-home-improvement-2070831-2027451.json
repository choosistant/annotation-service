  "reviewText": "These lights are very small.  I thought oh great, I felt like I was taken in.  WELL, I put them outside my door from my bedroom thinking oh well, whatever.  They light up like bright.  I was shocked to see them at night.  They stay on all night long.  They are dim unless someone or one of my 4 legged babies walk within a few feet of them and they go \"REAL BRIGHT\". \nI am extremely pleased with them. \nI would recommend these lights to anyone.  I really like them a lot,",
