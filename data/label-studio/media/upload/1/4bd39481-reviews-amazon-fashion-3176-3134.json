  "reviewText": "Super comfortable and fit my small feet perfectly. I have flat feet so a lot of shoes are not comfortable for long periods of time. I can wear the shoe all day long and they are super comfortable. They are light colored so any dirt will be seen right away, but they are easy to clean compared to other shoes Ive had. Would definitely buy another pair in a different color.",
