  "reviewText": "The Scotch Safe Cut Package does what it should:  cuts the tape to open boxes, or cuts thin (that's the key) plastic.  But why would you want this?  Far better, and far more used in our office, is something like this:[...]Pros:Safer than a regular box cutter (I am wondering if it would be allowed on a plane)Safer than using an open pair of scissors to cut open a box (this can be very dangerous)Nice handleCons:Limited usefulnessCan't cut cardboardCan't cut thick plasticIn sum, the product does what it says it will but a simple box cutter is much more versatile and long lasting.",
