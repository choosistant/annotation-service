  "reviewText": "I love my little sewing machine! I am not a big sew er but this is perfect for hemming pants or sewing blocks of material together for a blanket. It comes with extra needles and thread. It is easy to use and so handy! It is battery operated which means no cords to tangle up in. The directions are simple and clear and easy to understand. I am thankful for my discount and very happy with this purchase.<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/EIALA-Professional-Portable-Cordless-Handheld-Sewing-Machine-Quick-Stitch-Tool-for-Fabric-Clothing-or-Kids-Cloth/dp/B01E6SSMFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">EIALA Professional Portable Cordless Handheld Sewing Machine Quick Stitch Tool for Fabric, Clothing, or Kids Cloth</a>",
