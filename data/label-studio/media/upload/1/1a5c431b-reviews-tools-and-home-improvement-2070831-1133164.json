  "reviewText": "While it does look nice as pictured, the metal used is not exactly what I would call \"heavyweight\"-- rather, \"medium-weight\". Granted, for the price paid, I didn't expect something industrial duty. However, because of this (lack of) weight, the boards are prone to warping and bending under small amounts of weight (for example, four of them leaned up against each other in the shipping carton). The biggest part of this issue is not the actual warp of the panel, but rather, the warping of the folded section of metal that should be perpendicular to the wall when hung, which more or less will keep the whole panel warped unless fixed.  This CAN be done, but it's a pain. \n \nThe next issue I have with these panels is the \"included hanging hardware\"-- which translates to six sheet rock screws that absolutely WOULD NOT hold ANY type of weight of tools without anchors. Fortunately, I purchased mine to use as magnetic bulletin boards, but despite the fact that they will not hold much weight, I am STILL considering using some anchors on general principle. \n \nSo they lose points on weight and hardware-- but as I mentioned, they do look sharp, and they are (properly hung) quite functional. Had I not purchased these on a day when they were about 30% off the price I first saw, I would likely have given them fewer stars-- but can accept this as \"you get what you pay for\".",
