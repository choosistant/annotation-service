  "reviewText": "My first use of the kit was great and the wax worked well. But during the second use I noticed that wax was stuck to the side of the cup and wouldn't melt evenly resulting in a loss of wax. Third time was even worse as even more wax was stuck to sides of cup. Since the kit was on the pricier side I was hoping for more wax and less mess.",
