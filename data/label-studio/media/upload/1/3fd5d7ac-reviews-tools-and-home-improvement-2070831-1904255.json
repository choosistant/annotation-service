  "reviewText": "My heading says it all. It is a GREAT design but really inferior quality. WAY too lightweight in its girth. It needs to be as substantial as a \"Pony Clamp\" but is less than half that hefty.  So, I am torn in my overall attitude about this product. It's ability to act as a set of calls is really neat and incredibly useful during glue-ups. But you can't put much \"umph\" behind it or it will be in pieces. Combined with a quality set of bar clamps or trusty pipe clamps to augment your glue up process, the results will be satisfactory. \n \nI would LOVE to see a re-engineered version with the brawn this tool deserves.",
