  "reviewText": "Cons: Lights remain on only while in nearly constant motion, pause for only 30 seconds and you are in the dark.  You cannot force the lights to stay on with a switch if you are using this.  Range is quite short, it sees motion during the day within about five feet. \n \nPro: The lights come on immediately and gradually fade to off. \n \nThis is designed to be used in series from the power supply to the lights.  If you use this, it appears that there is no way to override the lights with a switch.  Therein lies the biggest problem.  Without modification, you will only have lights when you are in constant motion, near the sensor and when the lights in the room are off.  This is a great idea for a quick night snack or a night light. \n \nAlso, when the lights come on, you must be in constant motion and stay near the sensor. The lights power off after less than 30 seconds.  Using a cutting board or reading through a recipe is a long enough pause for the lights to turn off.",
  "summary": "Short range and doesn't stay on long enough",
