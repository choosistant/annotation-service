  "reviewText": "This product works as advertised and as with the other products from this manufacturer it is well made and reasonably priced. That being said, the motion sensor for me turns the lights off too soon. I would hope that you could adjust some settings that would allow the light to stay for a chosen period of time after sensing movement. The problem is I use these lights in my kitchen. So at night I have to wave my arms around to turn the lights back on because they go off so soon after this switch turns them on. \nI ended up purchasing the remote control with dimmer capability for these lights for me this works much better. Perhaps in different installations the motion sensor would be fine.",
