  "reviewText": "I ordered this model because out of all similarly constructed units this very specifically described itself as being 9.8 inches long. They also described a 6 inch dimension. I assumed the 9.8 was the unfolded length.., wrong. It is the length when utensils are extended. The 4 inch handle will barely fit my closed fist. The hammer or hatchet will come down and I'll crack my knuckles.  I'm sending this back. Will purchase a regular hammer/hatchet combo.",
