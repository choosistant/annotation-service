  "reviewText": "For maybe 15 years I have been using the same footrest under my workstations.  It's the tube kind with the board covered in some kind of vinyl for traction.  Maybe once or twice I tracked in some mud that got on the board.  Tapping the board over a garbage can knocked off the dirt. Every once in a while, I vacuum the board while getting up the dust bunnies.  So I am puzzled by the Microban Protection. I never touch the footrest with anything but the bottom of my shoes, other than the events previously mentioned.  Why would anyone sane care about microbes on a footrest? Or on the bottom of ones shoes for that matter?  I even sniffed at the old board, no moldy microbe smell.Next the rocking feature: As I write this review my feet are flexing back and forth.  I feel like a teenager with too much energy. When I really need to flex my foot, I stick it out and rotate the ankle a few times.  Rocking back and forth does not provide relief.  I tried this as a footstool last night while watching TV.  Nope, just another thing on the floor.At my home workstation we have a keyboard tray. Using this foot rocker under that desk was uncomfortable because even my short legs bumped against the tray.  Here at work, the rocker inches away. Then when I use it again it bumps against the wall. Fortunately the person on the other side is away now. I know I would be annoyed at random thumping.  The old footrest has rubber tubing that keeps it in place.  This thing skitters around.Assembly: The box is easy to open. A minimum of packing material is used. The pieces are well protected.  The instructions are simple drawings on box. You can figure it out with a moment or two of thought.  However the tolerances are quite tight, which is a good thing once the contraption is assembled.  I could not push the rocker into position bare-handed.  Fortunately I had a 15\" rubber mallet handy. A couple of taps and everything snapped into place.So if you are a nervous germaphobe who doesn't worry about your rocker bumping against the wall, perhaps this is for you.  And if it is, contact me and I will send you mine. I have no idea what I am going to do with this sample.",
