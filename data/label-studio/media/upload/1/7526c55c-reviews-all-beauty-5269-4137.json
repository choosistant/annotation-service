  "reviewText": "If you share a bathroom with a female, be it a wife, girlfriend, daughter, are roommate, you know what a loofa is because it is most likely hanging from your shower head right now.  And the Axe Detailer Shower Tool is basically a loofa marketed to guys.  The only thing different from the female in your life's besides the color scheme is the flip side that has a rougher scrubber on it for tougher places on your body like the feet, elbows, etc., but that side just feels like an afterthought and I found myself cleaning those areas with the scrubbing side after awhile.  In the end the Ax Shower Tool does get the job done and basically you need to ask yourself, \"Do I want another loofa hanging on my showerhead?\"",
