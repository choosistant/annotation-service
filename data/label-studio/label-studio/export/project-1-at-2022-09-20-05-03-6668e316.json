It is substandard at best and produces very  mixed results.Usually we print stuff on FAST (economy) and while the cartridge is rated for 200 pages, we actually got around 250-300 on the first one which puts it at around 125-150 for Normal.  (Usually fast\/economy uses half the ink as it only does a single pass instead of two or three)  The strange part is.. the second cartridge we got was terrible performance.  I estimate by around 150 Fast\/Economy the cartridge was starting to show it was almost out of ink already which would put it at around 75-100 pages normal!?I was a bit shocked because there was such a deviation.  I did some research and found out that HP rates their Cartridges using an ISO standard Text document. They test on a J4580 printer which is an INK SAVER printer. If you do not own a J4580 then obviously you will get different results.Because it is rated on a Text document keep in mind, print out a page that is loaded with black bars(like a bar graph) it will devour your ink; yet print out a page that has only a small amount of text you could go for 300+ pages easily.  I rarely complain about ink cartridges but I must say HP really should put some more ink into the standard 901 black; considering a 901XL has over 3x the rating (200 vs 700). Plus they should rate them using a \"Standard\" printer not an Ink Saver printer.  VERY MISLEADING !!OVERALLAvoid the 901 black!!  While they perform just fine and do have black ink in it that works, the cartridges performance is determined by how much black you print per page not by # of pages.  I would recommend instead spending the extra money and getting the 901XL black which is rated for 700 pages.  Once I got one of those I found I was able to print an entire ream of paper (500 pages) and the cartridge was still 50% full (all on economy\/fast)  So despite paying twice the price I already DOUBLED my output compared to a 901 standardIn short.. avoid!!  get the 901XL as it will pay for itself.","overall":1,"summary":"Avoid...

Actually, that doesn't bother me, although I have read that most printers will have ink that lasts longer.  The secret to this ink from HP is to buy through Amazon from `used' or `refurbished' sellers.  You can save nearly 50% on costs and some give you free shipping.  That's what I ended up doing.

This HP does not do well in reproduction, but for letters and ordinary flyers, its fine.","overall":3,"summary":"Not The Longest Lasting Ink","unixReviewTime":1281139200,"reviewTime":"08 7, 2010","reviewed_at":"2010-08-07T00:00:00","feedback_count":7,"feedback_helpful_count":7,"feedback_unhelpful_count":0,"feedback_helpful_ratio":1.0,"review_text_word_count":165},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-09-18T14:35:16.346415Z","updated_at":"2022-09-20T04:37:57.660768Z","inner_id":33,"project":1,"updated_by":2},{"id":32,"annotations":[{"id":27,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"start":176,"end":199,"text":"he ink doesn't dry out","labels":["benefit"]},"id":"mRLPif4Chd","from_name":"pros_and_cons","to_name":"review_text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":147,"end":170,"text":"it lasts me a long time","labels":["benefit"]},"id":"5yjZOWnNVc","from_name":"pros_and_cons","to_name":"review_text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-09-19T16:01:53.143049Z","updated_at":"2022-09-20T04:36:36.807629Z","lead_time":147.13400000000001,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":32,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"926c0f52-reviews_Office_Products_5-15185.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"index":15185,"reviewerID":"A2ZFBVF5EDMVBK","asin":"B0016P8Q22","reviewerName":"Maggie the Cat","helpful":[0,0],"reviewText":"Normally, I wouldn't say I loved an ink cartridge, but having gone through some cheap imitations, I now love the HP product.

My PC is for general-use with a non-studio configuration (no mixer, non-phantom power mics, headphone monitoring).If you're buying for a studio setup requiring phantom power or multiple inputs, you'll need a separate mixer and\/or standalone phantom supply. From the mixer you can cable to the US-100's line input via RCA jacks on the back.There were a couple of hiccups during setup, but I don't blame the device. It uses stock O\/S drivers that loaded right up. The documentation is minimal and only covers up to Vista, but it's accurate and you'll manage with Win7. On the Windows side make the USB AudioCodec your default recording and playback device to override any onboard or card-based audio and speakers (I have Realtek onboard and 2.1 desktop speakers).I'm using ASIO4ALL with Cubase and Cubase crashed a couple of times while configuring VST connections and I\/O busses. Once configured however, it's been solid.I'd recommend checking out user forums for your particular software\/platform to find similar gotchas and to set your expectations.On an XP machine, changing the default sound devices often means the hassle of toggling settings before and after launching the DAW. On Win7, once I unplug the US-100, the settings revert nicely to my desktop speakers. If I plug the US-100 back in, the settings revert again - very reliable. Even better, if I want to use Cubase strictly for MIDI, the software detects the change and I don't have to reconfigure connections or busses. That may be a function of Cubase, so again it pays to research your particular software.While the US-100 is connected, you'll hear nothing from your computer speakers and have to rely upon the US-100's headphone jack or audio out RCA jacks. This is where the balance control is very helpful. It's not a pan, it's a center position gain mixing the computer's output (from within your DAW as well as outside system sounds) with direct monitoring of your input signal. Very simple to use for overdubbing. Some people may prefer a hard left\/right pan while overdubbing: I can live with the center mix though a switch to toggle a true pan would have been a terrific feature.If you do want desktop speaker playback after your tracks are done, there are a number ways to go: 1) Unplug the US-100 and restart your DAW. 2) Run a cable from the RCA outs on the US-100 to the mini-jack aux in on your desktop speakers 3) Run a mini-jack extension cord from the headphone jack on the US-100 to the aux-in.While using the headphone jack, the RCA audio outs are muted and vis-versa.

I had always wanted an attack delay effect and the Behringer Slow Motion was priced well below all competitors. When it arrived, I tested it thoroughly and found that it is tricky to learn and limited in scope. It only works well under these circumstances: All notes must be played slowly, individually and deliberately in order for the attack delay effect to kick in. You can't play a quick series of notes and expect the effect to work properly. Having said that, I found that the effect is nice, once you have mastered the technique. I tried to use it in conjunction with overdrive and sustain pedals and it did not work well at all. Other reviewers have suggested using it with a digital or analog delay pedal, which I have not tried.

I bought it mainly to use with my (non-pedal) steel guitar. On a pedal steel you can bend notes with the pedals and levers, and most steel players use a volume pedal to do swells. However, I play standing up and manipulating the volume pedal was difficult to control because of balancing on one foot and the sensitivity of some of the pedals.This pedal gives a simulation of the volume swells that give steel guitar that distinctive sound. It's sort of like an automatic wah in the way it works. Since the steel is always being played by picking the individual strings (no chording), this pedal works along with that technique. I combine it with a sustainer to make the swells extend a little, and it gives a fair approximation of using a volume pedal to swell the notes.I tried this with regular guitar, but it's not the same. For chords, it does add an effect, but it's not very distinctive, and for single notes, it would depend on the song. I haven't really found many instances where it's useful there either, as I normally don't want volume swells for solos on guitar, but on steel guitar, it works very well.","overall":4,"summary":"Good for steel guitar","unixReviewTime":1400025600,"reviewTime":"05 14, 2014","reviewed_at":"2014-05-14T00:00:00","feedback_count":0,"feedback_helpful_count":0,"feedback_unhelpful_count":0,"feedback_helpful_ratio":0.0,"review_text_word_count":208},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-09-18T14:35:16.345311Z","updated_at":"2022-09-19T15:34:37.749212Z","inner_id":15,"project":1,"updated_by":3},{"id":40,"annotations":[{"id":15,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"start":111,"end":150,"text":"It does the job with a clear, red beam","labels":["benefit"]},"id":"si43nXmNZv","from_name":"pros_and_cons","to_name":"review_text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":151,"end":280,"text":"The only thing that was frustrating was that it was a push on button that released automatically when the pressure was taken off","labels":["drawback"]},"id":"--UXrDsLaR","from_name":"pros_and_cons","to_name":"review_text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":443,"end":545,"text":"aving it turned on without an operator holding it may be a hazard so I'm sure it is a safety feature","labels":["benefit"]},"id":"jtDdOWpLMR","from_name":"pros_and_cons","to_name":"review_text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-09-19T15:29:22.327031Z","updated_at":"2022-09-19T15:29:22.327066Z","lead_time":116.759,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"task":40,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"57f6e6cd-reviews_Office_Products_5-37082.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"index":37082,"reviewerID":"A1EVV74UQYVKRY","asin":"B0050PNOUS","reviewerName":"K.

Opens easily and folds up to a fairly small footprint for storage\/transport, and it cradles the guitar nicely.Two minor issues:1) Personal gripe - the git leans back a bit more than I would like.  Makes it more difficult to hug a wall and ends up taking more 3D space than it really needs.2) Product gripe - the two footer bars are not quite level with each other, so it rocks just a little bit.  However, with a solid body electric on it, even a little rocking can be a really bad thing.I like OnStage and own several of their products.  They are well constructed and a good value so I have no doubt I was just unlucky with this one.  I've been applying a little persuasion to even it out and it's getting better, but with the relatively robust construction it just doesn't want to give much.
