  "reviewText": "The angle on this laptop lift's angle is a bit severe for actual typing.  The picture on the box shows a lady mousing, so if you're just looking to have the screen lifted and not actually type at all, it might be a good fit for you.  Perhaps use it to watch movies?  Otherwise, I suppose you could plug in a USB or wireless keyboard to use with a laptop.  It would be nice to have it adjustable somehow.  But really, to use it for everyday use, the angle would need to be about half to stop wrist strain.",
