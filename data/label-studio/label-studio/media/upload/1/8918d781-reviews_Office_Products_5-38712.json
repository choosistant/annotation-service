  "reviewText": "These are very lightweight expanding document wallets (letter sized).They'd be fine for presenting documents/reports to a colleague, but I wouldn't recommend these for long-term document storage IF you are going to be in and out of the file quite a bit.  If you're using these for something like tax document storage (i.e. file & forget), they would work great.There is no velcro closure; this actually just closes with a standard colored elastic band.The colors are great and look much like the photo--definitely not drab; I just wish the paper they are constructed with was about 3 times as thick so the folder would hold its shape better and last longer.  But again, if you're using these for simple permanent document storage or for presenting reports, they would be a fine choice.",
