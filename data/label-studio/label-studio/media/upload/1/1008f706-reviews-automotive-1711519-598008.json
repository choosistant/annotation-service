  "reviewText": "The picture shows what looks to be a metal latch with a handle, but what I received was plastic with a plastic button.  I don't feel real confident in plastic parts located at the point that holds all the weight, but I haven't tried it yet, so we will see.  Seems a little flimsy for something that is supposed to stabilize a slideout.",
