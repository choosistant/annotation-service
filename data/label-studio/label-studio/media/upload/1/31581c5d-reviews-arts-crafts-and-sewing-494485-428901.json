  "reviewText": "The yarn colors are not as shown in the item photo which shows rainbow as having 5 different colors (including blue), and what I actually received had no blue at all ... and way too much green. \n \nUPDATE:  I looked this yarn up on the yarnspirations web site and found the example photo to not contain any blue.  from now on, before I order yarn, I'm double checking the color example's provided on amazon.  I know it hardly seems fair to rate the actual product by a photo description mistake, but the rating is a reflection of my disappointment in what I received compared to what I thought I was ordering.  if I had been able to see the correct product color photo, I wouldn't have ordered it.  for anyone ordering the \"rainbow\" yarn from amazon, just know there is no blue in it ... the photo is wrong.  it's just lilac, pink, yellow, and bright green (absolutely no blue!). \n \nI double checked the color photo of the \"pretty pastels\" with the yarnspirations site and it is the same, so I went ahead and ordered the pretty pastels.  in a \"rainbow\" i expect a little green. lol  but I'm pretty sure i'll also get the blue, this time, too.",
