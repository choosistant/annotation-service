  "reviewText": "I opened the box, and found the device was in 5 parts. Two 'wheels,' 'wheelcaps,' and the 'footboard.' I almost gave up trying to put the thing together, even though it was quite easy and not complicated to do, the parts did not fit properly and I found this frustrating. The footboard connected fine to the wheels, the wheels however did not slide to lock until I took a hammer and tapped the wheels to make the part slide down into place. Without the wheels being slid in and locked, you cannot attach the wheelcaps or at least I couldn't. I did not have the strength. The instructions were clear- it was just the sliding into place part which was a challenge.I was disappointed that there was nothing inside the box besides the parts. No manual to describe the therapeutic use of the product, just the product. The picture instructions on how to assemble the device were clear.I've used it for several days and while I like it- I do not love it. My sister complains it is squeaky, and I agree it squeaks even when rocked on the carpet. It is sturdy though. It stood up to the tapping hammer and the weight of my feet.  I think it should have a booklet to discuss the therapeutic uses of the device and to give the user some posture guidelines when using it.",
