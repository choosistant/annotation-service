  "reviewText": "This Fekkai conditioning mousse impressed. \n \nIt is very lightly scented just as promiseda bit of fruit botanicals and mint.  Fragrance is not noticeable after hair is dried and styled. \n \n I used it with varying shampoos, one of which was a Fekkai and it worked well with all of them. \n \nI used it with additional styling products and without (just the conditioning mousse). \n \nI used it with a large Spornette brush and a smaller Conair brush. \n \nIt worked well no matter the alternatives I used. \n \nMy hair feels full and looks full and lightweight.  It holds that fullness without any heaviness throughout the day. \n \nMy hair felt conditioned. \n \nUpon arising the next morning, I was pleasantly surprised to see that my hair still looked full and light with just a tiny bit of finger fluffing. \n \nIt is an additional boost to have the conditioner and mousse in one application and worth its cost. \n \nNote that during applicationshake the can well, then and use a light pressure on the nozzle.  A dollop seems to grow in size as you finger it through your washed hair.  Adjust to your own hair thickness and desired performance.",
