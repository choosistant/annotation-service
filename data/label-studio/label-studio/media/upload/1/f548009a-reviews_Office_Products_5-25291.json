  "reviewText": "These are great labels. The way they are layed out - top half receipt, bottom half mailing label - I thought they would be perfect for Amazon returns. But they are not. You would think they would have thought of that but they didn't, at least my attempt came out on two separate pages.I like the adhesive on the backs of these as they are easier to take off and run through the shredder. Of course that won't work for me but hopefully whoever sends me something will start using them - like Amazon.It's not that hard to setup a label for my own mailings so I will be able to use them for many things.",
