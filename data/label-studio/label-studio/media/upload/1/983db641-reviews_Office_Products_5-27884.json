  "reviewText": "This is a fun dictionary my son has used it to look up words and to find synonyms. We have also used it to practice with his spelling words. However it only quizzed him on the shorter words. The other reason I am giving it 4 stars is that it is pretty slow, it has some graphics before it gives the answers, this might be fun for a younger child but my 11 year old son was bored after the second time. Over all I do like this to add fun for spelling practice and dictionary skills.",
