  "reviewText": "This body lotion is lightweight and absorbs into my skin quickly, leaving my skin feeling moisturized but not at all sticky or tacky.  The lavender fragrance is strong at first, but settles into a more subtle scent (though its still very noticeable).  I don't have particularly dry skin, so this is moisturizing enough for me, but if you're looking for a very rich lotion this might be too light for you. \n \nLavender fragrances vary and I have to say this is not one of my favorites  a bit too perfumey for my taste.  The ingredient list is not impressive, just the typical chemical cocktail you find in most mass market products.  This lotion is just OK  Ill use up the bottle but I doubt Id purchase this in the future.",
