  "reviewText": "I'll come clean here ... I totally thought this was a leave-in. I had never heard of a \"mousse-style\" rinse-out conditioner. Luckily, I read the back before even hopping into the shower.  Now, I think the scent may be polarizing. For me, it translated as \"pleasant\" and \"clean\" (I thought it smelled like a blend of citrus and mint, which I found to be a very refreshing fragrance). I think because I gravitate towards the uncommon, this registered as very likeable. Now, I definitely used WAY too much the first time. (I think I just enjoyed the texture and the experience. LOL!) So, just be careful of that. Finally, it is easy to distribute and rinsed super clean. My only concern is any potential rust from the canister. I usually leave my shampoo and conditioner in the shower area ... but I was worried that this container could stain my tub/shower (I had done this accidentally with a shave cream many years ago). So, I find myself taking this into the shower and carrying it out of the shower ... and occasionally forgetting it, wrapping a towel around me and going to grab it. I guess, I'm flummoxed by metal containers in the shower. \n \nUnderstand, the conditioning aspect is very light (so as to allow for volume and movement), so if you have damaged hair, this may not be the best choice. However, it certainly does leave plenty of bounce. By all means, it does what it claims!",
