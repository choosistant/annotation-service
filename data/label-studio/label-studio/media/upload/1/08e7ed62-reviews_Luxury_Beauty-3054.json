  "reviewText": "I was looking for a wax to do in between my regular professional wax at the spa. I'm a regular but sometimes I can't get an appointment when I need it so I tried Bliss. I read all the reviews and everyone was spot on. My only issue was the fact that all the wax is not usable. All the product left on the sides of the cup never melts. I think that's a waste of money. The other thing is that it works better with small amounts of hair. I learned that the hard way.:(So all in all, I use it when I need a quick in between job but it certainly won't replace my trip to the spa!",
