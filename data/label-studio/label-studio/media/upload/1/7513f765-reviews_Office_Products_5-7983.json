  "reviewText": "This is an alright label printer...here are some pro's and con's I've noticed. Granted, I've only had the thing for a few days, but I can already tell what's good and bad about it.THE GOOD:-Prints pretty quickly (regardless of quality of the printjob....see con's for more details)-Dymo stamps seems to be a nice program (although I haven't used it yet)THE BAD:-THE USB CABLE THAT CAME WITH IT DOES NOT WORK! IT'S A DEAD USB CABLE; IT DOESN'T WORK ON ANYTHING! I TRIED USING IT WITH MY LASER PRINTER TO TEST IT AND IT DOESN'T WORK! IT'S RIDICULOUS......-It's HUGE! I had no idea how big this thing is! It takes up A LOT of space on my desk...I mean I--like most people--don't read the product specs to see how big it is. Even if I did, though, I would have never imagined that it would take up this much space!-Jams A LOT! Every second it jams, and then I have to press the feed button and take out a label and re-roll the entire spool. So I have tens of single labels just sitting around....because you have to remove the single label and re-thread the entire thing every time you want to print a label...-The software is A PAIN TO INSTALL! It took ten times for it to finally be installed. Maybe that's because THE USB CABLE THEY GAVE DIDN'T WORK....-The LabelDesigner program doesn't know what PROPORTIONS are! I had to print several labels and they all came out LOPSIDED or CUT OFF! I don't understand at all! They have pre-packaged labels AND pre-determined proportions RIGHT IN THE PROGRAM! You choose which size label you want, and it's SUPPOSED to work.I was expecting more from Dymo. I would NEVER pay $160 for it...luckily I got it a little cheaper.",
