  "reviewText": "This is the famous Milton red stapler from the movie \"Office space\".This thing is built like a German tank.  Solid and heavy.  It can kill somebody if you throw it as a weapon.  The color is more like an orangey (if there such a word)  red.  Anyway, every detail on this stapler is great.  The steel is thick gauged.  Paint looks like baked or dipped and not something you can easily chipped.  Nice simple classic style.Of course, I bought it because of that Milton guy in that movie \"Office Space\".  But really, it is such a handsome piece of equipment.  This is one quality product.  Love it; and I would really hate anybody stealing it from my desk!",
