  "reviewText": "Maybe I don't get the point with this. Okay, they use sex to sell it; I get that. It's supposed to create a situation in which women - I'm assuming really dumb ones - are made out of control in your presence after using it. Right. And Yaks fly. \n \nBut is there anything truly unique about it? \n \nWell, it does have sandpaper sides, one of which would remove the face off a statue and other that buffs your flesh to a tender red. But other than that it's just sort of a sponge. The `directions' say it gets all those special places (if we all have them are they really so special?) but I think a washrag does a better job. \n \nSo why am I even thinking about this thing this much? I'm done and I'm outta here - to find my washcloth.",
