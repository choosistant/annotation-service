  "reviewText": "...they don't reveal the word \"open\" in red when unsealed, as the product description states.  The paper quality is rather basic, but as with most \"security\" envelopes, there is a blue patterned print inside to prevent seeing and reading through.  The tucked-over adhesive flap takes a little getting used to, but it's nice not to have to worry about that waxed paper strip that comes off of most self-adhesive envelopes, and the adhesive itself is fairly strong - it's very hard to reopen the envelope without tearing it apart.  All in all, it's a decent product.",
