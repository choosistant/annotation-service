  "reviewText": "I gave this \"tool\" an average rating.  It does do what it promises but it falls short on innovation.  The soft mesh are a dime a dozen at any wal-mart and the rough side does the exact job a hand towel can do.  Putting them together... good marketing, not a great idea.  You can get the mesh and a hand towel for a fraction of what this sells for. \n \nThe biggest problem with putting them together is that when one side wears out you must replace them both.  A hand towel lasts forever and you don't need to replace it when the mesh wears down, unless you own this product. \n \nSo, I'm using my last one.  I see no reason to get more of these.  Just pick up your own and save the cash.",
