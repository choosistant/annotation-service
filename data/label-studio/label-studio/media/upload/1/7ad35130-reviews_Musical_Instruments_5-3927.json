  "reviewText": "Currently using this with the Blue Yeti microphone and the Blue Radius Shock Mount. When fully extended, the arm can't hold the entire weight of the shockmount+Yeti microphone. I rigged it behind my monitor wall mount frame (didn't want to mount the montiors to the walls) and it works just fine.Not as fancy as a retractable arm, but it does the trick just fine.",
