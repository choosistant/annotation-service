  "reviewText": "This product lifts my laptop to the perfect height, but the angle of the height is a bit too steep.  After two hours of using it my wrists hurt. This product would be perfect if it allowed the user to adjust the resting angle.  Since I want to use this for work, the adjustment feature is very important in my overall rating.  Other than that,  there is no assembly required so you basically are ready to go as soon as you receive the product.  The front tabs kept my laptop in place and the elevated curve design kept the laptop cool.Review update (May 8, 2013)I received feedback on my review from the makers of this laptop lift.  Just to ensure I was giving them a \"fair\" review, I tried using the lift again and followed the instructions they provided - they said \"make sure the front lip of your Laptop Lift is placed at the very edge of your desktop.\"  It didn't work.  I started feeling discomfort around the second hour.  This time my wrist and arm started \"hurting.\"  Again, this product is great if the angle of the lift doesn't affect you in a negative manner.  For me it doesn't work.  I wish it did. :)",
