  "reviewText": "I thought the brushes were too big or that they needed a variety of sizes.  They only have two sizes even though there are 4 brushes.  The box is gorgeous.  The baby spoon in it is absurd and needs to be a tad bigger.  I just felt for that price I could buy the stuff I wanted individually in a much better quality or other specific that I liked better.",
