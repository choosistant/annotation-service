  "reviewText": "Everyone who has seen Office Space knows this iconic device.  Mine arrived in perfect condition, but after several uses, with the premium staples Swingline recommends, it started to jam and bind.  I bought this to use in my Information Technology class that I teach.  I tought the students would get a kick out of it.  I eventually replaced it with a staple-free stapler that works much better and reqires no refills.",
