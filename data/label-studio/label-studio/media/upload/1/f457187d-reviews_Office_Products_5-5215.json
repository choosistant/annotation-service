  "reviewText": "The first red Swingline stapler made it's appearance in Mike Judge's movie Office Space. I have to say that both the movie and stapler are great. An interesting bit of trivia: -- there was no such thing as a red Swingline stapler when the movie was made. The prop department spray painted a black model. But high demand from fans of the movie prompted Swingline to release a red model in 2002. They were a bit behind the times since other companies had colored staplers much earlier (Bates Colormatics for one).Okay, it looks neat and is a conversation piece, but does it work? Yes, so far. There's nothing I hate more than a stapler that always jams. It was a gift, and replaced a generic black model in office. It uses the same common #4 staples so there's no need to invest in a new box if you already have a supply of them. It is billed as a \"Collector's Edition\", but heck, these things were made to be used. Enjoy!",
