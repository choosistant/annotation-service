  "reviewText": "I'm new to the fountain pen world... I've bought a lot of pens and several inks in a short amount of time. I've got a Lamy Black-Blue (don't love it), the Diamine Rustic Brown (it's nice, but wish it were a little more red), Noodler's Bulletproof black (awesome) and this. This is by far my favorite ink. I love how it dries. It's deep red. It's not the fastest drying ink and in my impatience I will periodically smudge it but that doesn't bother me much. if I wait an extra few seconds it will dry and be fine. I use this with F and EF nibs. Love it.",
