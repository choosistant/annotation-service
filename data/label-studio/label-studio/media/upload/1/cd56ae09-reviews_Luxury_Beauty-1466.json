  "reviewText": "I bought this after watching a youtuber recommend this. I've got to say, the first time I used it I was like ??what??This thing has a slightly weird smell and it is very thick and slightly oily to the touch. The exfoliating beads are also barely there. But, the ingredients in this are really good so I decided to use it for a little while and see.After I used this for about 2 weeks, my skin seems to have adjusted to this and I genuinely like it. This makes my skin very soft and smooth. It's really moisturizing and it's cured the flakiness of my skin that usually happens during winters. This might not be as great to use in the summer though but I've really enjoyed the gentle exfoliation of the jojoba beads. Overall, I'd say I'd buy it again next winter to keep my skin baby soft.",
