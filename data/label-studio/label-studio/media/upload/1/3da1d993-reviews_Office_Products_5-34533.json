  "reviewText": "I own the Pebble tape dispenser in the same line and I love it. It looks gorgeous and works well. I reasoned that the post-it dispensers would be equally winning. I bought 3, one for each office and one for home.They arrived and I thought I might have misread the listing since they seemed like seconds. The tops are all scratched up on all three. The cover piece (lid) does not secure so every time you pull out a note it shifts. There does not seem to be a way to \"lock\" the top in place.At the time I bought these they were offered by Amazon (in the Prime program) and were a lot less expensive. Now I see they are a third party vendor item. Regardless, I'm disappointed. The only worse thing would have been paying more for them.",
