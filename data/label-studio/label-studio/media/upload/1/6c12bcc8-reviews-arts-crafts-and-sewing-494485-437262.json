  "reviewText": "Very disappointed in this yarn. Made into a keyhole scarf. Soft, warm pretty color and easy to work with BUT within 3 weeks the yarn got terribly fuzzy all around the edges and around the keyhole opening. It's been worn 6 weeks and now is a limp as a dishcloth.  Money and time down the drain and it's expensive yarn.",
  "summary": "No thanks. Too expensive to perform so poorly.",
