  "reviewText": "Make sure you realize that these labels include only one label per sheet (about half the page), and the other half of the page is to be used as a paper receipt.But first ask yourself, do you really need a paper receipt for every label?  This is wasteful, not environmentally friendly, and will consume expensive printer ink. Why not keep an electronic record instead?If you do, however, need a paper receipt consisting of half a page for every shipment, then this may be a good choice.However, due to the price tag, it might actually be less expensive to do multiple labels per page (using a different product) and then multiple receipts per page (using standard printer paper).Personally, I use just regular printer paper for my labels and then Scotch tape to attach them to the package :-)  That way, I never have to worry about thick labels getting jammed in the printer and/or having to put different paper in the printer.",
