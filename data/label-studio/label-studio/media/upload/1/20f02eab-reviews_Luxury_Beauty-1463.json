  "reviewText": "I LOVE Juice Beauty products but the Exfoliating Cleanser that I ordered online via Amazon does not look or smell like the product I ordered off of the Juice Beauty website, or purchased in-store at Ulta.This product has a very odd smell and the color is more orange than the typical white/off-white product that I have previously purchased.Overall, I am pretty disappointed. I will absolutely order my products off of other sites in the future...I am not convinced that what I received was the original Exfoliating Cleanser made by Juice Beauty.",
