  "reviewText": "I read the reviews of the few similar options. I went with this one because reviews of the competition talked about how far back the guitars lean. Not much of that complaint here. But this definitely has that problem.My guitar is quite stable leaning back less than a third of what this stand causes. So this can't go in several out-of-the-way places I had hoped would work. Also, I was hoping to use two of these close together for a compact 2-guitar rack. However, the angle makes that very awkward.I hope to modify it to work, but I'm not super hopeful at this point. Will probably have to manufacture something to replace it..",
