  "reviewText": "I use this rocker at my desk at home.  The room is fairly thickly carpeted which seems to prevent the creaking that some have complained about.  My rocker's motion is smooth and fluid  with nary a squeak or creak to disturb the peace and the platform surface feels  good on my bare feet, giving them a massage while I'm rocking.  Since I do prefer to go barefoot especially in the warmer weather, I appreciate the Microban  antimicrobial protection that the rocker provides.  It's just one less thing to be concerned about.The Fellowes Foot Rocker is solid.  It doesn't \"go walking\" and I've never had it move out of place when I didn't want it to; it seems to stay put just fine but on the few occasions when I wanted to reposition it, I had no trouble.  It's lightweight and maneuverable unlike an older footrest I had that seemed to have been made of lead.  My husband put it together for me.  He didn't have any trouble with it and it took him only a minute or two so I would say that assembly shouldn't be an issue.While of course, it's not a workout, it does provide some benefits such as improved circulation  and is certainly preferable to just sitting there stock still while working at the computer.  It's simple and painless and I actually enjoy using it.",
