  "reviewText": "This set is beautiful in a silk box.  It came packaged well and arrived in perfect condition. The ink stick grinds nicely the grinding stone.  The brush rest, bowl, and red seal ink container are beautiful in ceramic blue and white!  The brushes are good quality, hold water and ink and no shedding. The soapstone seal is also beautiful and adds to the signature on your sumi-e art. All you need is some rice paper.",
