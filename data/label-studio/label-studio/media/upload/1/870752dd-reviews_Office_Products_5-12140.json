  "reviewText": "I really like this color as it is very bold!! However be warned..it clogged both of my fountain pens...on was an Ahab and the other was a  Parker! The converters are so sticky after this ink that they are useless... not to mention it will stain anything it comes into contact with!! I only use this ink in a TWSBI 540 as it has not clogged and continues to write smoothly! I will never use this ink in my Pelikan or Vanishing Point!! However, for my dip pen...its fine!",
