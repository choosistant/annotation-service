  "reviewText": "My son needed a laser pointer for a science experiment and this was in the price range we were willing to pay. It does the job with a clear, red beam. The only thing that was frustrating was that it was a push on button that released automatically when the pressure was taken off. That meant that it had to be physically pushed while trying to measure points on a wall. That left us with wiggle room as we applied pressure to it. I guess that having it turned on without an operator holding it may be a hazard so I'm sure it is a safety feature.",
