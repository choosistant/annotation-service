  "reviewText": "Lavender is my favorite soap fragrance, so it's no surprise that I love this PRE DE PROVENCE FRENCH LAVENDER BATH & SHOWER GEL.  For the shower, a pump or two is enough for a nice lather, and the lather washes off easily. \n \nThe lavender fragrance is delicate, and it lingers for only a short time.  It doesn't overwhelm perfume, aftershave lotion, shampoo, or other scented products you may like to use.  The clear gel arrives in an attractive square pump dispenser. \n \nThe shower gel leaves my skin silky smooth, and it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin.",
