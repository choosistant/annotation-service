  "reviewText": "Self sealing envelopes are not a new idea.  Where I grew up, that's all we've had available to us for all of my lifetime, so I was surprised to come to live in the US and find that people were still licking envelopes to close them.  When I saw this item, my first thought was \"oh, thank goodness - at last!\"  The self-seal aspect of the envelope works very well.  The glue seems to seal the envelope well and keep it sealed.  The only issue I have had with them is that the glue seems to want to hold the flap down prior to use and I had to ease it up in order to fold it in and seal it.  My concern would be that with time, the flaps might actually seal open and thus be unusable.These envelopes also have a security feature to allow you to mail checks without risk that the contents of the envelope can be read.  I can't remember the last time I needed to mail a check so I will not need to use them for this purpose.  Nevertheless, being able to send correspondence with full assurance that the envelope cannot be held up to the light and the contents read through the paper, provides a degree of confidence in the product.Last, I wanted to add that the paper from which the envelopes are made is high quality, thick paper.  The envelopes do not feel flimsy at all.  I suspect this makes them less likely to be torn while going through the postal machines, and in fact less likely to get in or cause a jam of the USPS equipment.",
