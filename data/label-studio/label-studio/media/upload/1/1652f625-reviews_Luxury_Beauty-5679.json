  "reviewText": "I received this sample and just loved it so I decided to purchase the full size. First off, it is organic, so that is great! Secondly, it is such a nice formula. It just glides onto your skin and absorbs very nicely. Last, I suffer from acne and have sensitive skin and it did not irritate my skin or cause any problems for me at all. I purchased a bunch of other products from Juice and can;t wait to receive te rest! :-)",
